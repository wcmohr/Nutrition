# Nutrient absorbtion
* food matrix effects
    * vitamin c and iron absorbtion
    * antinutrients

# Constraints
* cost
* health factors
    * Neu5Gc - [A red meat-derived glycan promotes inflammation and cancer progression
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4299224/)
    * Primary and secondary metabolites not found in traditional nutrient databases, i.e
    * Phytonutrients, flavanoids/flavanols, purines (1,2).
    * Heavy metals

# Computation
* missing value imputation
* categorization (plant, animal, vegetable, fruit, nut, etc.)
* nutrition label & ingredients list to arrive at ingredient proportions
    
# Glossary
1) Primary metabolites are necessary for plant life and include carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, lipids, purines, and pyrimidines of nucleic acids()
2) Secondary metabolites in plants are classified into three main groups based on their biosynthetic pathway; (a) nitrogen-containing compounds such as alkaloids, glucosinolates, and cyanogenic glycosides, (b) phenolic compounds such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, and (c) terpenes
