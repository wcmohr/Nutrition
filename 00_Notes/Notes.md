Subtract nutrients satisfied by a set number of servings of certain foods from constraints, optimize around that.

Input a dietary pattern and determine nutrient intake

# Check units!


To solve for food 'weights' for food package such as cali mix frozen veggies:  use weight, ordering of ingredients, nutrients.  
    * Need more equations than unknowns
        * weight of a serving of the package, weight of a serving of components
        * fat, sat. fat, fiber, carbs, protein, minerals, vitamins, etc.
        * ordering of ingredients
        * how to optimize?


Imputing nutrient values for frozen from fresh food form based on factors for similar foods, i.e. frozen from fresh broccoli based on frozen from fresh cauliflower.
